 - qtextbrowser.h now has a thin wrapper around std::stack
   Everything compiles but there is still some issue with QString template
   
bm2017-may-24
 - added Changelog.txt
 - modified Configs/Linux-g++-shared
 - modified qvaluestack.h to allow full compile to proceed

Observations:
  QValueStack was released with GCC-3.0. It fails with improved compilers.
  The current goal is with GCC-4.9.2 on Debian 8.x   With the patch to
  qvaluestack, the QT libraries compile, the tutorials and most of the
  examples run.  However, the designer does not compile because an XML
  parsing error.

  The designer uses QStack but the XML parser in qml.h uses QValueStack.
  So my thinking is to replace QValueStack with QStack.
