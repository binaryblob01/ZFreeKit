-----------
- Fails to compile on newer systems due to requiring AT&T-style yacc. Update Makefile.in in src/moc/ to use byacc instead of bison.
GNU bison will not work.

- byacc error caused by what I presume to be a bug in bison/byacc with yydebug. Modified src/moc/moc.y to disable yydebug, for now.
Need permanent fix later. Basically:
With bison 2.7 YYDEBUG will be set to 0 if it was not set, then #ifdef
YYDEBUG returns true, but bison 2.7 treets YYDEBUG 0 as not set.

- Workaround in configs for linux-g++ platforms that complain about not being able to find ft2build.h, even though it's present.

- fixed qvaluestack.h::pop2() .. QT2 original QValueStack.pop() has
 different semantics than std::stack.pop(). I added .pop2() and altered
 the source to use the new version. Now everything compiles.
 examples/xmlquotes now works. Correct compilation depends upon xml parsing.

- The code is compiled on 32-bit Debian 8.8
 I changed "-Wall" to "-w" because there were so many trivial warnings.
 I prefer not to have warnings but fixing these ambiguities in strange
 code could actually introduce bugs.  Warnings should be fixed all
 during developement so that important problems are not obscured.

 - qvaluestack.h now has a thin wrapper around std::stack
   Everything compiles but there is still some issue with QString template

 - added Changelog.txt
 - modified Configs/Linux-g++-shared
 - modified qvaluestack.h to allow full compile to proceed

Observations:
  QValueStack was released with GCC-3.0. It fails with improved compilers.
  The current goal is with GCC-4.9.2 on Debian 8.x   With the patch to
  qvaluestack, the QT libraries compile, the tutorials and most of the
  examples run.  However, the designer does not compile because an XML
  parsing error.

  The designer uses QStack but the XML parser in qml.h uses QValueStack.
  So my thinking is to replace QValueStack with QStack.

------- preliminary notes ------------------------------------------
Qt232 can compile on Debian 8 (Jessie). Here is setup:-
  sudo apt-get install g++
  sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
  sudo apt-get install libxext-dev
  sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev

There are many warnings about strings so adjust configs/linux-g++-shared
   SYSCONF_CXXFLAGS	= -pipe -O2 -w
   SYSCONF_CFLAGS	= -pipe -O2 -w

cd /usr/local/qt
configure

It is important to read "porting.doc"
Also, try "grep -ri danger * | less"

There is an issue with templates where QValueStack extends QValueList.
According to docs, QValueList::remove(p) expects p=Iterator but
g++ 4.9.2 disagrees. Note below p='const char*'
