A quick note on licensing.

The contents of the ZFreeKit collection are licensed under several licenses.

ZFreeKit includes the Qt library, which is dual-licensed under the QPL (Q Public License) and the GNU GPLv2.
Because some applications that use Qt2 may use it under QPL licensing, we are opting to dual-license all of our changes and updates to Qt.
This means that we provide all of our changes and updates via patches in order to comply with the QPL. These patches can be used under either license.
